# C# Kata 4: JSON

**Complete all of Kata #3, but this time:**
 
- Instead of creating separate players in the **Program.cs** class, load the **player-data.json** file (using Newtonsoft.JSON) and pass the contents into a `Leaderboard.AddPlayers` method. This method should automatically instantiate `Player` objects.
- Feel free to use List this time!
